./deploy.sh should switch versions correctly
  - project/run.sh will need to be idempotent
  - test


cron job is running as root, not wwwuser.
  - testing, it works to copy the cron file from /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root to wwwuser, but we don't want to move all of roots cron if there are others
  - we should be able to write the file directly to /var/spool/cron/crontabs/wwwuser, but that didn't seem to work (try again)
  - watch http://serverfault.com/questions/604720/can-i-use-reboot-in-cron-d-files


project/run.sh
  - create pm2 task if it doesn't exist
  - restart pm2 task

project/prerun.sh
  - npm rebuild
  - migrations
