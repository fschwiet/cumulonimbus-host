testing workflow:
  - developer includes their working tree / .git folder within the /vagrant folder
  - developer must commit what they want to test first...
  - developer starts test run
    - [? pm2 logs are cleared]
    - ssh is used to deploy their last commit to the VM
    - tests run against the VM
    - [? pm2 logs are output on test failure ]
  
nice-to-have: stop using raise wrong.  See: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/4036 

nice-to-have: check if using pm2 delete will do a graceful shutdown

nice-to-have: store cron job in /etc/cron.d/<filename> instead of /var/spool/cron/crontabs/<username>
  - saw some notes that /var/spool data might get cleared, in particular when chron is updated
  - not sure @reboot can be used with a username column, it hasn't worked.
  - watch http://serverfault.com/questions/604720/can-i-use-reboot-in-cron-d-files
