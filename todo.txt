account wwwwuser fails to run pm2 since it doesn't have a home directory


project/run.sh
  - create pm2 task if it doesn't exist
  - restart pm2 task



Can't log in as wwwuser, though can sudo su wwwwuser  


set up cron to run run.sh in vagrantfile




project/prerun.sh
  - npm rebuild
  - migrations
