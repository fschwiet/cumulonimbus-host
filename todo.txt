pm2 list -name doesn't work as expected in run.sh  (its listing all processes)


use vagrant-secret for wwwuser password


nice-to-have: store cron job in /etc/cron.d/<filename> instead of /var/spool/cron/crontabs/<username>
  - saw some notes that /var/spool data might get cleared, in particular when chron is updated
  - not sure @reboot can be used with a username column, it hasn't worked.
  - watch http://serverfault.com/questions/604720/can-i-use-reboot-in-cron-d-files
