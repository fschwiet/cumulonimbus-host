./deploy.sh should switch versions correctly
  - project/run.sh will need to be idempotent
  - test



project/run.sh
  - create pm2 task if it doesn't exist
  - restart pm2 task

project/prerun.sh
  - npm rebuild
  - migrations
  


nice-to-have: store cron job in /etc/cron.d/<filename> instead of /var/spool/cron/crontabs/<username>
  - saw some notes that /var/spool data might get cleared, in particular when chron is updated
  - not sure @reboot can be used with a username column, it hasn't worked.
  - watch http://serverfault.com/questions/604720/can-i-use-reboot-in-cron-d-files
