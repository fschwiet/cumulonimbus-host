vagrant@vagrant:~$ cat /var/log/cronrun
  ./run.sh: 3: ./run.sh: pm2: not found


why is crontab still being updated for root?
  - try copying the generated root crontab to wwwuser and see if it is runs
    (this didn't seem to work, though maybe the logfile failed to record since wwwuser does not have write access to log folder)





project/run.sh
  - create pm2 task if it doesn't exist
  - restart pm2 task

project/prerun.sh
  - npm rebuild
  - migrations
